# Assignment 6

The objective of this assignment to implement **Inverse Kinematics** with 3 joints and 9 degrees of freedoms using the **Jacobian Transpose Method**. The implementation takes the x, y, z coordinates of the target end effector, the overall bone linkages then converge to a position & rotation such that the final end effector reaches/approaches the target end effector.
